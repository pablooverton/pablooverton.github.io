As a Lead Data Engineer, I've spearheaded large-scale projects, efficiently transforming complex business requirements into resilient data architectures and pipelines. My role extends beyond technical expertise; I'm a mentor, coach, and a staunch advocate for software engineering best practices within my team.

Outside the office, I'm deeply engaged with open-source software and constantly exploring the forefront of machine learning and AI technologies. I actively participate in hackathons and enjoy working on IoT projects, blending my passion for both hardware and software. When I'm not engrossed in code, you'll likely find me delving into sci-fi literature, experimenting with home automation gadgets, or attending local tech meetups. Join me as I share insights, tips, and my passion for data engineering on this exciting journey.
